## 🖋️ App's Description

This app is more than just a nice addition to your life; it is intended for use in helping you to overcome addiction. It provides inspirational quotes every hour to help you stay motivated. If you want, you can log your progress in an easy manner, and a streak counter will be there to keep you pumped up with motivation for all your hard work.

## 💡 Concept

I’d like to utilize an app to help people overcome addiction. The idea is to give addicts a daily progress tracker. It's the accountability and motivation that is necessary for them to succeed.

## 🔒 Privacy

All data will remain **local** on the user’s device because I want to respect the user’s privacy. The app would be open source.
